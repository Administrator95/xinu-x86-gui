- colors in galaga
- after galaga gameover does not restart well
- textbox overflows text
- behaviour of mouse in virtualbox is not correct
- when X button closes dynamic window, process does not finish
- it is not a bug, it is a feature. BUT we need to understand this feature:
    you can not have two windows with the same title (if you have, you will see
    just one window).
