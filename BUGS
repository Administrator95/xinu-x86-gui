- colors in galaga
- after galaga gameover does not restart well
- textbox overflows text
- behaviour of mouse in virtualbox is not correct
- when X button closes dynamic window, process does not finish
- it is not a bug, it is a feature. BUT we need to understand this feature:
    you can not have two windows with the same title (if you have, you will see
    just one window).



vtty.c code :
    vtty_in_new_char(int n, char c)	 /* new key stroke c from n virtual terminal */
	put c in buffer of n vtty (using semaphore)
	send message to vtty_in process
    
    there is a vtty_in process, waiting for a message
    when it arrives, get every char from in buffer and does the same code
    than ttyhandler_in(), but inside this process with the ch


    there is a vtty_out process, waitin for a message
    when message arrives it gets chars from out buffer of tty
    for every char it calls to vt100_put_char(n, c); /* n is the vt virtual terminal */

    tty_putc  send message to vtty_out process (when it does ttykickout for real tty)


vt.c reads chars from microui events, then calls vtty_in_new_char().
then
